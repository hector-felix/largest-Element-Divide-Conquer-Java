# largest-Element-Divide-Conquer-Java
Design an algorithm that uses divide and conquer to find out the largest element in an integer array. Time complexity of your algorithm should be O(n), where n is length of the array. Write the pseudocode of your algorithm
and explain why the time complexity of your algorithm is indeed O(n). Note that you can use Algorithm 2 as the
template of your pseudocode.
